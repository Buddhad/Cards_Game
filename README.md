## What it does

This game works to match the cards of the Letters if it matches then you won the game.

## How we built it

I built this game using Javascript, Html and CSS.

## Challenges we ran into

The most challenging part was to match every card and give the scores.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

This made this word game and it's working perfectly that we accomplish.

## What we learned

We learned how to do the map and hash in Javascript.

## What's next for WordGame

After the word game, I will try to make a 2D platformer game.
