## What it does

This game works to match the cards of the Letters if it matches then you won the game.

I built this game using Javascript, Html and CSS.

The most challenging part was to match every card and give the scores.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

This made this word game and it's working perfectly that we accomplish.

## What we learned

We learned how to do the map and hash in Javascript.

## What's next for WordGame
